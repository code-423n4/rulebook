# Code4rena DAO Constitution

### 1 — Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

**1.1 DAO.** Code4rena is a DAO, an unincorporated association of individuals, entities, and/or groups of persons who all agree to join together in a common purpose.

**1.2 DAO membership.** Members of Code4rena include:

- holders of $ARENA tokens, which shall include any persons or entities delegated tokens under Section 3.4 (collectively, ”Token-Holders”);

- anyone who contributes to the community, such as chat participants, forum discussion participants, wardens, judges, sponsors, and contracted entities and their employees (collectively, ”Community Members”), many of which may also be Token-Holders.

### 2 — Principles

This Constitution, and all other actions of Code4rena should be interpreted to follow these principles, if at all possible.

**2.1 Nondiscrimination.** Code4rena shall not discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or otherwise.

**2.2 Community safety.** Members of the Code4rena DAO shall be bound by the Code4rena Code of Conduct, which shall be prominently displayed to new Members upon joining the community.

### 3 — Governance

**3.1 Member governed.** Code4rena is governed by Community Members who participate through chat conversations, forum discussions, and by Token-Holders who make and vote on on-chain proposals made using a governance smart contract (”Proposals”). The Code4rena governance smart contract is located on the Polygon blockchain at the address 0xc6eaDcC36aFcf1C430962506ad79145aD5140E58.

**3.2 Actions not requiring a vote.** In matters where a vote is not required, it shall be the preference of the DAO to operate by delegation to Contracted Entities (Section 5) or by the use of Working Groups which are made up of 3-5 Community Members with relevant expertise, and which reach decisions through the use of [rough consensus as defined by the IETF](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-resnick-on-consensus-01.html).

**3.3 Actions requiring a vote.** Amendments to the Code4rena Constitution, changes to governance, token issuance, and use of DAO treasury must be proposed and voted on by Token-Holders.

**3.4 Token delegation.** Token-Holders may delegate proposal and voting rights to the address of their choice within the restrictions of the smart contract enabling delegation. Any Community Member can participate in Code4rena governance by receiving delegation without needing to own tokens themselves.

**3.5 Amendments.** Changes may be made to this Constitution only by a two-thirds majority vote of Token-Holders’ tokens with at least 20,000,000 of tokens participating.

**3.6 Prevailing authority.** In matters where the Constitution and a smart contract disagree, the Constitution shall remain the prevailing authority.

### 4 — Proposals

**4.1 Use of process.** Where the DAO establishes organizational processes for creating and refining draft Proposals, Members will use these processes as a first course of action.

**4.2 Minimum required tokens to propose.** Token-Holders with at least 50,000 tokens may make Proposals for actions the DAO may take.

**4.3 Quorum.** In order to pass, Proposals will require a simple majority vote with a minimum of 10,000,000 Token-Holders’ tokens participating.

### 5 — Delegation of authority

**5.1 Contracted parties.** For actions taken by the DAO requiring the action of a legal entity, the DAO may delegate authority for any functions to a Contracted Party with a specifically enumerated scope. Contracting these entities shall require a passing Proposal.

**5.2 Lawful actions.** Actions the DAO instructs Contracted Parties to undertake shall be carried out so long as it is lawful for them to do so and the actions do not conflict with this Constitution.

**5.3 Responsibility to hire and fire.** The DAO retains absolute authority to fire and hire Contracted Parties.

**5.4 Use of proper channels.** If the DAO or any Member of the DAO wishes to direct a Contracted Entity, it shall do so solely through a Proposal, or a Working Group duly formed for that purpose.

### 6 — Revocation and suspension

**6.1 Good standing.** A Member shall be deemed to be in “good standing” unless their membership has been revoked or suspended pursuant to this Article. Any references to the rights or entitlements of Members shall be understood to refer to only to Members in good standing.

**6.2 Applicable circumstances.** In the case that a Member breaches the Code of Conduct, is charged with a crime, or confesses to or is determined to have engaged in criminal or unethical acts in a court of law, is subject to applicable economic sanctions, or in the case that continued membership would be unlawful for the DAO or its Members, their Membership may be revoked or suspended in accordance with Article 6.3 below.

**6.3 Revocation and suspension of membership.** Revocation or suspension of membership shall occur through a vote of the Token-Holders, or by a decision of a Contracted Party to whom the responsibility for community moderation has been delegated, so long as the Contracted Party has published procedures for revocation and suspension.

### 7 — Settlement of disputes

**7.1 Informal negotiation and mediation.** In any dispute between Code4rena and any current or former Members, or between Members (or former Members), which cannot be resolved through informal negotiation, it shall be the policy of Code4rena to prefer the use of mediation whereby an impartial mediator may facilitate negotiations between parties and assist them in developing a mutually acceptable settlement.

**7.2 Litigation as last resort.** No Member, former Member, Contracted Party or the DAO itself with a grievance against another Member, former Member, Contracted Party, or the DAO itself shall have recourse to litigation until the matter is submitted to mediation and attempted to be resolved in good faith.

### 8 — Miscellaneous

**8.1 Indemnification.** To the fullest extent allowed by law, the DAO shall indemnify and hold harmless any founder, Member, Token-Holder, Contracted Party, their officer, directors, employees, agents or assigns, or any other person or entity acting at the direction of or on behalf, or for the benefit of, the DAO (”Indemnified Party” or Indemnified Parties”), against any third-party complaint, government action or other loss incurred as a result of an Indemnified Party’s action or inaction taken at the direction of or on behalf, of or for the benefit of the DAO.

**8.2 Severability.** In the event that any provision of this Constitution is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to such extent and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law without affecting the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Constitution.

**8.3 Binding.** This Constitution shall be considered binding for all Members of Code4rena. Agreement to this Constitution shall be a condition of participating as a Member, Community Member, Token-Holder, or receiving awards or compensation from Code4rena.
