# Code4rena Contest Rulebook

Code4rena is an interdependent community of people doing highly subjective work in a greenfield industry. 

In order to facilitate consensus building among the commmunity, this repository contains the mechanism, rules, and best current practices (BCPs) of Code4rena contests:

- **[Mechanism](mechanism.md)** represents the fundamentals of how audit contests work, how awards are distributed.
- **[Rules](rules/)** support the mechanism with nuance applied in subjective scenarios. (Some rules may become part of the core mechanism if they gain enough consensus and maturity to be able to be interpreted objectively.)
- **[Best Current Practices (BCPs)](bcps/)** are community-driven standards intended to provide guidance for sponsors, judges, and wardens. (Some BCPs may become eventually rules.)
