## Code4rena Contest Rulebook

Code4rena is an interdependent community of people doing highly subjective work in a greenfield industry. 

In order to facilitate consensus building, this repository contains the mechanism, rules, and best current practices of Code4rena contests:

- **Best Current Practices** are community-driven discussions intended to provide guidance for sponsors, judges, and wardens. You can find discussions of best current practices in open [rules issues](https://github.com/code-423n4/org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Arules).
- **[Mechanism](mechanism.md)** represents the fundamentals of how audit contests work and how awards are distributed. (minimal currently)
- **[Rules](rules/)** support the mechanism with nuance applied in subjective scenarios as interpreted by judges (NOT STARTED YET)


### Contributing to the rulebook

Pasted from [this chat thread introducing this repo](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810936719003090974/938416619800129546) to provide some context in the absence of any documentation for this repo yet :)

> +1 to it being super helpful for wardens to help identify which things from past contests seem like they may be outliers.
> 
> Can we ask everyone to file issues on this repo for each case that stands out as a deviation or a place where the rule seems inconsistently applied? 
> 
> We are intending to develop as the single source of truth for which things are hard and fast rules vs more subjective and still developing.
> 
> One absolute requirement: let’s make sure issues are filed as neutrally worded inquiries rather than that turning into a public complaint field about how your own submissions were judged. (There is no code of conduct in the repo yet, but this will be there when we get a chance.)
> 
> Tip: If you feel strong emotion as you’re filing an issue, it would be wise to take a step back for a bit and then come back later and try to submit your issue as a neutral scientific examination.
> Creating this rulebook will be a collaborative effort between all members of the community, and eventually we will have clear processes created and documented for how changes are proposed and made.
> 
> Right now we’re bootstrapping it, so please feel free to contribute however you see best and we’ll start to work to sort the chaos out as a community.
The structure is not set in stone either; do feel free to make suggestions for how it could be improved
